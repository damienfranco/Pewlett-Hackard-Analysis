# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## **Overview of Project**

We analyzed data from Pewlett Hackard to determine how many employees will retire in the next few years. Our criterion was based on birth dates ranging from 1952 to 1955 and hired dates from 1985 to 1988. This information will help us prepare for future retirements and hire new staff. We also identified employees that could be utilized in a mentorship initiative to help new employees adjust to working at our company.

## Results and Findings

- There are over 300,000 current employees at Pewlett Hackard, of which over 33,000 (~11%) are at retirement age.
- Senior level positions make up the bulk of titles for expected retirees with Senior Engineer and Senior Staff leading the pack.

- We identified ~ 1,500 employees that would be elible or qualify to be part of a mentorship program that could help allievate some of the stress caused by a large incoming workforce.
